# Data Science Projects

This repository contains two data science projects I worked on:  

1. **IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
2. **Bike Rental Prediction Model**

## ðŸ“Š Project 1: IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”¹ Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze IPL ball-by-ball data to uncover meaningful insights about teams, players, and match situations.

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- **Source:** IPL deliveries dataset (CSV file)  
- **Features:** Ball-by-ball details such as batsman, bowler, runs scored, wickets, extras, match IDs, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- Identifying:
  - Top batsmen and bowlers  
  - Extra runs conceded by bowlers  
  - Player matchups and strike rates  
  - Team performance trends (e.g., in Powerplay or Death overs)  

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸš² Project 2: Bike Rental Prediction Model

### ðŸ”¹ Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts bike rental demand based on environmental and seasonal conditions.

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- **Source:** Bike Sharing Dataset  
- **Features:** Hourly/daily records including temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, holiday, working day, etc.  
- **Target:** `count` (number of bikes rented)

### ðŸ”¹ Approach
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns  
- Model building using:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - (Additional models can be tested for performance comparison)  
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score  

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
